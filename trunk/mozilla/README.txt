README for building a Mozilla for Komodo
========================================

This source tree provides for making builds of Mozilla -- primarily to
support Komodo. Basically it contains a number of patches to the Mozilla
sources and some build scripts that know how to checkout Mozilla from
CVS, apply the patches, and build.

For build instructions, please read the top-level "../README.txt".
