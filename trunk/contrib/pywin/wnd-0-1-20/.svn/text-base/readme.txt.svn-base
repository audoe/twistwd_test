wnd is a python only gui framework for win32 systems, 
using low level MS api calls. It lets you setup highly native
guis with low memory footprint and low distibution size. 
 
The module comes equipped with wrapper classes for  
comon controls, common dialogs, classes wrapping gdi 
functionality, a bare bones dialog and menu editor and other
modules peeking into the world of the win32 api. A documentation
in chm format comes shipped along with the module


The project is hoted at  http://sourceforge.net/projects/wnd/
