1. In jsdICallHook::onCall(jsdIStackFrame frame, type)

frame sometimes contains garbage -- in particular sometimes
the PC contains garbage values (which seem to be taken from
a small set of possible values), and trying to get the line #
from the PC triggers an access violation.


2. When jsdIScriptHook::onScriptCreated(jsdIScript script)

We can't always get the source for the script, particularly if
the script was loaded by using the 
("@mozilla.org/moz/jssubscript-loader;1", mozIJSSubScriptLoader).loadSubScript
method.
