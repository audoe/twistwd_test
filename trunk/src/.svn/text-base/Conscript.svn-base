# The deletion of the compreg.dat file is one of the few hacks that I
# could find to trigger f*(#ing PyXPCOM re-registration. It *used* to be
# that a "bk build" involving a change in our .idl files would result in
# re-PyXPCOM-registration on next start, but something changed to stop
# that. I've found this full reregistration is necessary to get a *new*
# interface working via "bk build" -- i.e. without having to do
# "bk clean && bk build".

# - The Komodo idl files are handled by each $cons->BuildAndInstallXpt().
# - To support C++ XPCOM components we'll also need the "include" and "lib"
#   Mozilla SDK dirs.
# - Not sure we need $mozDevelDist/sdk/bin/regxpcom.exe.
# - We use the much smaller set of Mozilla IDL files in dist/sdk/idl (~100
#   files) rather than the full set in dist/idl (~1000 files). The smaller
#   set are those with "@status FROZEN", plus some deprecated APIs.
#   Notable IDLs missing from the smaller set are the nsITree-related
#   and nsIAutoComplete (for textbox autocomplete) IDL files. Some of
#   these we cherry-pick. For example, an extension can't build a
#   custom koIAutoCompleteResult without the nsIAutoComplete*.idl files.
# - Add as many of the xpidl.exe dependencies as we are able (some of them
#   are GPL'd). For some case we'll just have prerequisites (e.g. MacPorts
#   on OSX and certain packages on Linux).
