- brainstorm how the Django server-side stuff would work 
- use all the JS libraries off this post for stress testing the JS

- <constant>
- <mixin> or <module> or something for this. The processing is just different
  and keying off of a __mixin__ attribute is more painful: I think.
- A generic/easy way for a language to have implicit variables in certain
  scopes. E.g. "self" everywhere for Ruby (meaning different things in
  different scopes, see play/whatisself.rb). E.g. "this" in C++. Or should we
  just have the "self" variables actually put in by the CILEs and have them
  marked "__hidden__" or "__implicit__"? The latter sounds more sane.
- a separation of the concept of a class object and a class instance object
  for the <type> of something. For one, this is important for choosing btwn
  Ruby instance methods and class methods. The same for Python, but this kind
  of thing is much more common in Ruby.
- usage of <returns> and the required extensions to CITDL and processing for
  that
- improved CILE processing to get better docs and better type info:
    - define things users can do to help improve
- improve clarity of CodeIntel names vs. language specific names
- faster CILEs
