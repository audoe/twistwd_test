Changes to Luddite

Version 1.1.0 - February 23, 2007

- Added the clear_delimiter action

This is needed to handle cases where we might have matched
a delimiter, but need to investigate further to determine
whether we succeeded.  So on the first match we include
a keep_delimiter action, and then if we've got it, we
issue a clear_delimiter action.  This is used to
implement here-documents.
